IDenty is a next-generation token launchpad powered by on-chain AI.
Built on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP), IDenty redefines fair token distribution through fully autonomous biometric recognition. Anyone can launch assets on-chain, with distribution tied not to speed or connections, but to behavior-based AI scoring—ensuring fairness at scale.

But IDenty goes far beyond launch mechanics. It introduces a new paradigm for human-AI interaction, identity verification, and behavioral authentication, all fully on-chain.

AI-Powered Interaction, On-Chain
Forget forms, passwords, or even DIDs. On IDenty, all you need is a camera. Through advanced AI inference running directly on the blockchain, the system can recognize facial features, detect behaviors, and respond in real time—all without ever compromising user privacy. Every interaction is processed in the user’s personal canister, meaning no centralized servers, no data leakage.

Real-world actions become smart contract inputs:

Plant a tree on camera and earn a verifiable environmental badge.

Show your face, and verify your identity from anywhere in the world.

Move, act, or interact, and let AI interpret those actions on-chain.

Everything—and everyone—can become an agent in the blockchain world.

Rethinking Token Distribution
Fair doesn’t mean equal, and it certainly doesn’t mean inefficient.
IDenty introduces a novel distribution model using error-fitting AI. Instead of a flat or winner-takes-all system, users engage in recognition-based challenges, and the results determine allocation. The more accurate your interaction, the more you earn. Bots and sybils can’t fake their way through it—only real behavior counts.

On-Chain Identity, Without Centralized KYC
Traditional KYC is invasive, centralized, and exclusionary. IDenty replaces it with on-chain recognition that’s fast, private, and equitable. There’s no need to submit documents or go through third-party verification. Your identity is validated through behavior, and stored securely in your own canister.

IDenty also offers verifiable credential services for other projects. Any dApp or platform can integrate these identity proofs via API, creating a unified, secure, and tamper-resistant identity layer across the ICP ecosystem.

Vision for the Future
Our mission is to rebuild trust in identity systems through transparent, AI-driven protocols. By leveraging the Internet Computer’s unique architecture, we’re building a decentralized foundation for identity, verification, and tokenization—where users own their data, control their interactions, and benefit directly from their participation.

As we move forward, we aim to extend the power of Internet Identity, enabling even richer interactions between users and smart contracts—without ever compromising on privacy or autonomy.
